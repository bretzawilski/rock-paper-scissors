# Rock, Paper, Scissors with a Computer
This is a simple javascript application that allows the user to play a best-of-5 game of rock, paper, scissors with the computer. As a project in development, eventually I will use it to develop a basic GUI version of the game.

So far, I have learned:
- modular design via functions
- troubleshooting human input errors
- basic game loop functionality
- scoped variable usage for let and const
